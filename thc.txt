## The Garden Song [^garden-stalker] ## {#garden}

*"Where's Spike when you need him?"* \\
*"I'm warning you."* \\
*"You're warning me?"* \\
*"Hey, cut it out."* [^garden-976evil]

I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom \\
I see the flags are flying high \\
I hear you've gone and rearranged things in your room \\
I guess you're trying to cut off my air supply

I came toward your window, real slowly \\
I knew deep down I was about to strike oil \\
I guess by the now the flowers in your garden know me \\
I felt them trying to get at me through the soil

My bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt \\
Moving up my ankles, but I don't fear you \\
The thorns began tearing at my shirt \\
But I didn't even care when they tore clear through

Your garden can't hurt me \\
Your flowers don't threaten my life \\
Your garden can't hurt me anymore \\
Your flowers don't threaten my life


[^garden-976evil]:
    This sample from the film [976-EVIL][976evilwiki] appears to continue throughout the entire track; but only the first part, before the song starts, is audible. At approx. 57:30 in the movie there is a fight between two high school-aged boys:
"Where's Spike when you need him?"
"I'm warning you"
"You're warning me?"
"Cut it out"

[^garden-stalker]:
    This song is narrated from the perspective of a stalker, a subject which John has since distanced himself from: \\
\\
"Like a lot of college singer-songwriter guys, I thought it'd be really intense if you had songs where the rejected lover is, like, totally stalking somebody. You may find this with your guys with acoustic guitars in college, is that they write these songs and they think that you will like them better if the protagonist in their song is, like, stalking his beloved. Guys are confused; they grow out of this, right? But for the moment, they really think it's super intense to have a narrator who's going to immolate himself if he doesn't get the love he wants. I went through that myself with the songs; this is on The Hound Chronicles and I feel really silly playing it. It's called 'The Garden Song'." -- [2006-12-02 - Pitzer College - Claremont, CA][2006-12-02]

## Going to Wisconsin [^wisconsin-goingto] ## {#wisconsin}

There was the sound of a lake boiling over \\
On that day \\
Everyone said just to sit still \\
But the thickening air got in my way

So the hook's been baited now \\
Yeah the cheese is on the water \\
Yeah the water's been cleansed of all impurities [^wisconsin-fishboil] \\
But now it really doesn't matter \\
Let's go, let's go

Wisconsin bound \\
Wisconsin bound \\
Wisconsin bound, yeah \\
Wisconsin bound

The bottom of the boat was a hotplate come alive \\
But the boat wasn't real, and this is how I feel \\
You don't know where you are until you arrive \\
And the frogs sang out from the distant banks \\
And you say you need me in California \\
But no thanks 

Wisconsin bound \\
Wisconsin bound \\
Wisconsin bound \\
Yeah, Wisconsin bound \\
Let's go

## Spilling Toward Alpha [^spilling-alpha] [^alpha-forgive] [^alpha-kill] ## {#spilling}

I hear you moving in the hallway \\
I hear you sharpening your claws \\
I hear you polishing your teeth sometimes \\
But I don't mind

And I hear you out in the garage \\
I hear you messing with the motor \\
I hear you tinker with the engine sometimes \\
But I don't mind

And I hear you moving in the kitchen \\
I hear you in there late at night \\
I notice when you leave the gas jets on sometimes \\
But I don't mind


[^spilling-alpha]:
    Spilling Toward Alpha is part of the [Alpha Couple series][alphacouple].

[^alpha-forgive]:
    "This is another one of those little songs, uh, about two people who I love so much that I continue to cause them to harm one another, uh, and I imagine them in my mind cursing me, but they can't do it without my permission, 'cause they're my people, so. It's a very old song. I hope someday they'll forgive me, but I suspect that they won't." -- [2001-06-23 - Bottom of the Hill - San Francisco, CA][2001-06-23]


[^alpha-kill]:
    "This song also has a message, but it's a sort of simpler message. And that is: if the person that you live with and love is trying to kill you, it's best to leave." -- [2002-03-07 - Independent Media Center - Urbana, IL][2002-03-07]

## Alpha Negative [^negative-alpha] [^death-heart] ## {#negative}

The house was pretty and the yard was wide \\
And I felt strong with you at my side \\
Your eyes at night had a beautiful glowing in them \\
And I knew in my heart just what was growing in them

Ah, but you made me drink poison \\
It felt smooth running down my throat \\
I love you, and you made me drink poison \\
It was cool and smooth and sweet \\
Do you remember?

We had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard \\
And I quit my job, so I could hold you all the time \\
I tried to stop the thing metastasizing [^alpha-cancer] in us \\
But in the warm, slow evening \\
I could feel it rising in us

Ah, and you made me drink poison \\
It felt so smooth sliding down my throat \\
I love you so much, and you made me drink poison \\
It was cool and smooth and sweet and cool \\
And smooth and sweet and cool and smooth


[^negative-alpha]:
    Alpha Negative is part of the [Alpha Couple series][alphacouple].

[^alpha-cancer]:
    metastasizing means to spread or change injuriously, especially used in pathology to refer to cancer spreading from one body part to another.

[^death-heart]:
    "Well, there was this one guy who always wanted to hear that one. He's been showing up for twenty years. But everybody else was like, 'Wow, that was weird and not like the other songs. It seemed like it was written by a very different person who, you know, had a little more death in his heart than the other one we've come to know, right. That's true.'" -- [2014-04-20 - Old Town School of Folk Music - Chicago, IL][2014-04-20]

## Torch Song [^torch1] [^torch2] ## {#torch}

The sun was coming up, and our friend was sound asleep \\
But we saw through the window that the water ran so deep \\
That you couldn't make out the ocean floor \\
Then I saw you in the light \\
I couldn't take it any more

Give me your hand \\
Give me everything you've got \\
And the light from window will fall on us burning hot  \\
Just like a torch

The air was humid; I will not forget \\
When we stepped outside, I hear your footsteps \\
Now in my mind, it's a soft sound \\
Almost imperceptible against the giving ground

Let me kiss your eyelids with my lips \\
Let me feel the heat coming off your fingertips \\
Just like a torch

## The Cow Song ## {#cow}

Bang pow, look at me now \\
Don't let the cows stray off too far \\
Come down, take a good look around \\
See how the cows start to shine like light bulbs

I love the cows \\
I love the cows \\
I love the cows, yeah \\
I love the cows

Rain comes, strikes you dumb \\
Re-seed the meadow so the cows don't starve \\
Mud puddle's a fine place to cuddle \\

## Standard Bitter Love Song #4 [^bitter-series] ## {#bitter}

Well I see you've left me a photograph \\
Of a leopard tearing an antelope in half \\
What have you done \\
What have you done \\
What have you done \\
With our love \\
What have you done

Well I see you've resorted to petty theft \\
You want to take something from me \\
But there's nothing left \\
What have you done \\
What have you done \\
What have you done \\
With our love \\
Where have you put it

Well I hear you calling from way over there \\
And I can't find it anywhere \\
What have you done \\
what have you done \\
What have you done \\
With our love \\
What have you done

## Going to Mexico [^mexico-goingto] ## {#mexico}

I saw you at your window \\
I saw you in the sun \\
I saw you in the window looking out

I reached my hand in there \\
Then I touched your hair \\
And felt myself burn in the morning

And the chickens were screaming \\
Black dog at my heels \\
And the bluejays were coughing up in the trees

I'd forgotten my name \\
I felt kind of ashamed \\
And felt myself burn in the morning

I saw you at your window \\
At the beginning of summer \\
And invisible stars sent their heat down

I imagined your touch \\
It was almost too much \\
Burned like a bonfire in the morning

Bryce- just so i don't forget, there was a comment about this being a true story in one of the interviews from Christopher's flikr I'll find next time

## Lab Rat Blues ## {#rat}

I saw you. I saw your hair \\
I could spend the rest of my life in there

I saw you and I sank into your eyes \\
I'm not going to apologize

Because you with your own hands \\
Made the whole world [^rat-psalms] \\
You can't fool me \\
I'm onto you now

Because you with your own hands \\
Created everything \\
You can't fool me \\
I'm onto you now

Yeah, I saw you, but you saw me first \\
Living water to quench my thirst [^rat-water] \\
And you tell me quiet down [^rat-luke] \\
But I have no doubt \\
I know what you're all about

Because you, with your own hands \\
Made the whole world \\
You can't fool me \\
I'm onto you now

Because you, with your own hands \\
Created everything \\
You can't fool me any more \\
I'm onto you now


[^rat-psalms]:
    Referencing God creating everything with his hands. Multiple Bible verses use similar language, such as Isaiah 45:2, "I made the earth, I created the people who live on it. My hands stretched out the heavens, I gave orders to all the heavenly lights"; Psalms 8:3 observes that the heavens were "made by God's fingers" and Psalms 19:1 "The heavens declare the glory of God; the sky displays his handiwork."

[^rat-water]:
    Water is a rich symbol in the Bible. In Jeremiah 2:13 and 17:13 God calls himself "The living water." Jesus speaks about it in John 4:10, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."

[^rat-luke]:
    Possibly a reference to Luke 4:35, in which Jesus silences a possessed man who is afraid of him and rebuked the demon inside him. "Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. However, God often instructs silence, quiet, peace etc and there are many hundreds of verses which encourage this practice.

## Going to Kansas [^kansas-goingto] ## {#kansas}

You were all were dressed in green \\
Clouds bounced against the edges of the sky \\
You had the prettiest hair I'd ever seen \\
We saw the world passing by

There was an ocean's droning \\
Though we were nowhere near the shore \\
We heard each other giggling and moaning \\
Then we couldn't hear each other any more yeah

When my head was resting on your breastbone \\
I could hear your beating heart \\
24 hours later you had left me completely alone \\
I heard the whole world come apart

And you were all dressed in green \\
Rising in the sky was an unfamiliar star \\
You know, you know what I mean \\
Yeah I remember who you are

## The Water Song [^water1] [^water2] ## {#water}

Water came springing out the side of the wall \\
And I guess the same thing will happen to us all \\
We don't know how to explain what I mean \\
I mean to say it's kind of hard to explain now

Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me

Water came down through the cracks in the ceiling \\
But this time the water had a different feeling \\
It's the sort of feeling that is hard to explain \\
So, let me put it to you in a different way now

Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me

You're the salesman. I'm the buyer \\
You're the tractor. I am the tire \\
I'm the glass. You're the water that fills me \\
I hear them coming now \\
Let them kill me

Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me \\
Let them kill me now \\
Let them kill me. Yeah!

Let them kill me \\

It can't touch me

I see you going up the little stair \\
Go on and board the plane \\
I don't care I-

I see you hold his hand \\

## Keep It on Your Mind [^keep-cover] [^keep2] ## {#keep}

*"It's a quarter 'til 2 on the 23rd of February and this is a Hank Williams song."*

Now if you stay out \\
And start playing around \\
Your baby's gonna burn your playhouse down \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You'll be a-moanin' and a-groanin' \\
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Now wrong is wrong \\
And right is right \\
If you make a pig mad \\
He's sure gonna bite \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
I've had it proven to me \\
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Every fuss got the same old end \\
I don't believe the good lord \\
Meant for a man to win \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You'll be a-groanin' and a-hoppin' \\
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Now if she gets mad \\
And tells you goodbye \\
There's not a thing that you can do \\
But sit at home and cry \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You better keep it on your mind \\
You better call her sweet mamma \\
Lord, you better keep it on your mind
