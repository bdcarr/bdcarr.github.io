<p>I leave the house as soon as it gets light outside <br />
Like a prisoner breaking out of jail <br />
And I steal down to Business 15-501 <sup id="fnref:sage4"><a href="#fn:sage4" class="footnote">7</a></sup> <br />
Like I had a bounty hunter on my tail</p>

<p>And somebody stops to pick me up <br />
But he drops me off just down the block <br />
And along the highway where the empty spirits breathe <br />
Wild sage growing in the weeds</p>

<p>Walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps <br />
Headed vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes <br />
And I lose my footing and I skin my hands breaking my fall <br />
And I laugh to myself and look up at the skies</p>

<p>And then I think I hear angels in my ears <br />
Like marbles being thrown against a mirror <br />
And along the highway where unlucky stray dogs bleed <br />
Wild sage growing in the weeds</p>

<p>And some days I don&#8217;t miss my family <br />
And some days I do <br />
Some days I think I&#8217;d feel better if I tried harder <br />
Most days I know it&#8217;s not true</p>

<p>I lay down right where I felt cold grass in my face <br />
And I hear the traffic like the rhythm of the tides <br />
And I stare at the scrape on the heel of my hand <br />
&#8216;til it doesn&#8217;t sting so much and until the blood&#8217;s dried</p>

<p>And when somebody asks if I&#8217;m okay <br />
I don&#8217;t know what to say <br />
And along the highway, from cast-off innumerable seeds <br />
Wild sage growing in the weeds</p>

<p>Shadows on the broad lawn, canopy of trees <br />
Sometime after midnight the ground is gonna freeze <br />
Birds in the frosty air <br />
What are they doing there?</p>

<p>Greenhouse full of butcher&#8217;s-brooms <sup id="fnref:avenue4"><a href="#fn:avenue4" class="footnote">11</a></sup> <br />
Breezes at my back <br />
Sometime before the sun comes up <br />
The earth is gonna crack</p>

<p>I look down at my hands <br />
Like they were mirrors</p>

<p>Fresh coffee at sunrise <br />
Warm my lips against the cup <br />
Been waiting such a long time now <br />
My number&#8217;s finally coming up</p>

<p>All the neighbors come on out to their front porches <br />
Waving torches</p>

<p>It was raining outside, so I cleaned house today <br />
Spent half of the morning throwing old things away <br />
Try not to get caught up <br />
Try to think like a machine <br />
Focus in on the task <br />
Try not to think about what it means</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t get you <br />
Out of my head <br />
Lost without you <br />
Half dead</p>

<p>Took my spot at the window <br />
Looked at the road <br />
Dots and dashes of traffic <br />
Like a message in code</p>

<p>And whole boxes of memories <br />
Wrapped up at the curb <br />
I sang songs to myself <br />
Didn&#8217;t have any words</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t get you <br />
Out of my head <br />
Lost without you <br />
Half dead</p>

<p>Stole out to the backyard late last night <br />
Pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight <br />
Rising like giants from the cold earth <br />
What are the years we gave each other <br />
Ever gonna be worth?</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t get you <br />
Out of my head <br />
Lost without you <br />
Half dead</p>

<h2 id="lonely">Get Lonely <sup id="fnref:lonely1"><a href="#fn:lonely1" class="footnote">15</a></sup></h2>

<p>I will rise up early and dress myself up nice <br />
And I will leave the house and check the deadlock twice <br />
And I will find a crowd and blend in for a minute <br />
And I will try to find a little comfort in it</p>

<p>And I will get lonely <br />
And gasp for air <br />
And send your name off from my lips <br />
Like a signal flare</p>

<p>And I will go downtown, stand in the shadows of the buildings <br />
And button up my coat, trying to stay strong - spirit willing <br />
And I will come back home, maybe call some friends <br />
Maybe paint some pictures, it all depends</p>

<p>And I will get lonely <br />
And gasp for air <br />
And look up at the high windows <br />
And see your face up there</p>

<h2 id="wings">Maybe Sprout Wings <sup id="fnref:wings1"><a href="#fn:wings1" class="footnote">16</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:wings2"><a href="#fn:wings2" class="footnote">17</a></sup></h2>

<p>A bad dream shook me in my sleep <br />
And I woke up sweating <br />
Ran through the dark to the shower <br />
Already forgetting</p>

<p>Try to think good thoughts <br />
Trying to find my way clear <br />
Let the room fill with steam <br />
Trace pictures on the mirror</p>

<p>Ghosts and clouds <br />
And nameless things <br />
Squint your eyes and hope real hard <br />
Maybe sprout wings</p>

<p>I clawed my way to the living room window <br />
Stood there in the cold <br />
The last bits of my dream like figures in the distance <br />
Hard to hold</p>

<p>I thought of old friends <br />
the ones who&#8217;d gone missing <br />
Said all their names three times <sup id="fnref:wings3"><a href="#fn:wings3" class="footnote">18</a></sup> <br />
Phantoms in the early dark <br />
Canaries in the mines <sup id="fnref:wings4"><a href="#fn:wings4" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Ghosts and clouds <br />
And nameless things <br />
Squint your eyes and hope real hard <br />
Maybe sprout wings</p>

<p>I went down to the gas station <br />
For no particular reason <br />
Heard the screams from the high school <br />
It&#8217;s football season</p>

<p>Empty lot the station faces <br />
Will probably be there forever <br />
I climbed over the four foot fence <br />
I was trying to sever the tether</p>

<p>Moon in the sky <br />
Cold as a stone <br />
Spend each night in your arms <br />
Always wake up alone</p>

<p>I lay down in the weeds <br />
It was a real cold night <br />
I was happy &#8216;til the overnight attendant <br />
Switched on the floodlight</p>

<p>Walking home I was talking to you under my breath <br />
Saying things I would never say directly <br />
I heard a siren on the highway up ahead <br />
Kinda wished they&#8217;d come and get me</p>

<p>Frost on the sidewalk <br />
White as a bone <br />
Tried to get close to you again <br />
Always wake up alone</p>

<p>And as I was crossing our doorstep <br />
I hesitated just a moment there <br />
Remembered the day we moved into our small house <br />
&#8216;Til the vision got too vivid to bear</p>

<p>You were almost asleep <br />
Halfway undressed <br />
I lay right down next to you <br />
held your head against my chest</p>

<p>And a guy with any kind of courage <br />
would maybe stop to think the matter through <br />
Maybe hold you still and raise the question <br />
Instead of blindly holding onto you</p>

<p>But we crank up the heat <br />
And you giggle and moan <br />
Spend all night in the company of ghosts <br />
Always wake up alone</p>

<h2 id="places">In the Hidden Places <sup id="fnref:places1"><a href="#fn:places1" class="footnote">23</a></sup></h2>

<p>Autumn came around like a drifter to an on-ramp <br />
There were wet leaves floating in gutters full of rain <br />
Took to walking barefoot around town <br />
Melodies from grade school kicking in my brain</p>

<p>Saw you on the crosstown bus today <br />
You were reading a magazine  <br />
I turned my face away <br />
And I shut my eyes tight <br />
Dreamed about the flowers that hide from the light <sup id="fnref:places2"><a href="#fn:places2" class="footnote">24</a></sup> <br />
On dark hillsides in the hidden places</p>

<p>The brakes howled and the bus pulled up near my house <br />
And I got off at the corner <br />
Pulled my sleeves down over my hands, over my hands <br />
And I wished I was someone else <br />
And I wished it was warmer</p>

<p>And when I got home I thought about you <br />
Like a desperate policeman searching for clues <br />
And I almost passed out just then <br />
And I shut my eyes again <br />
Headed for the dark hillsides <br />
In the hidden places</p>

<h2 id="giants">Song for Lonely Giants <sup id="fnref:giants1"><a href="#fn:giants1" class="footnote">25</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:giants2"><a href="#fn:giants2" class="footnote">26</a></sup></h2>

<p>No one washed behind my ears <br />
High in the trees alone for years <br />
Practicing my solitary scales &#8216;til they rose like balloons <br />
Watching them go where they will go</p>

<p>Face in the leaves  <br />
Song in my throat <br />
Fall through the air <br />
Hoping to float</p>

<p>Practicing my solitary scales &#8216;til they grow heavy <br />
Too heavy to carry <br />
Watching them go where they will go</p>

<h2 id="woke">Woke Up New <sup id="fnref:woke1"><a href="#fn:woke1" class="footnote">27</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:woke2"><a href="#fn:woke2" class="footnote">28</a></sup></h2>

<p>On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time <br />
I felt free and I felt lonely and I felt scared <br />
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately <br />
Not being used to being the only person there</p>

<p>The first time I made coffee for just myself I made too much of it <br />
But I drank it all just &#8216;cause you hate it when I let things go to waste <br />
And I wandered through the house like a little boy, lost at the mall <br />
And an astronaut could&#8217;ve seen the hunger in my eyes from space</p>

<p>And I sang oh, what do I do? <br />
What do I do? <br />
What do I do? <br />
What do I do without you?</p>

<p>On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time <br />
I was cold so I put on a sweater and I turned up the heat <br />
And the walls began to close in and I felt so sad and frightened <br />
I practically ran from the living room out into the street</p>

<p>And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend <br />
And the world, in its cold way, started coming alive <br />
And I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train <br />
And I got ready for the future to arrive</p>

<p>And I sang oh, what do I do? <br />
What do I do? <br />
What do I do? <br />
What do I do without you?</p>

<h2 id="light">If You See Light <sup id="fnref:light1"><a href="#fn:light1" class="footnote">29</a></sup></h2>

<p>When the villagers come to my door <br />
I will hide underneath the table in the dining room <br />
Knees drawn to my chest</p>

<p>When the villagers come to my door <br />
I will breathe shallow breaths from high up in my stomach <br />
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah</p>

<p>Waiting for the front door to splinter <br />
Waiting all winter</p>

<p>When the villagers come to my door <br />
I&#8217;ll be all tucked away with my face to the floor <br />
And my eyes closed</p>

<p>And no one knows how to keep secrets &#8216;round here <br />
They tell everyone everything soon as they know <br />
And then where is there left for poor sinners to go?</p>

<p>Waiting for the front door to splinter <br />
Waiting all winter</p>

<h2 id="tattoo">Cobra Tattoo</h2>

<p>Sun just clearing the tree line when my day begins <br />
Slippery ice on the bridges, north-eastern wind coming in <br />
You will bruise my head, I will strike your heel <sup id="fnref:tattoo1"><a href="#fn:tattoo1" class="footnote">30</a></sup> <br />
Drive past woods of northern pine, try not to let go of the wheel</p>

<p>Dream at night <br />
Girl with the cobra tattoo <br />
On her arm <br />
Its head flaring out like a parachute</p>

<p>Prisms in the dewdrops in the underbrush <br />
Skate-case sailor&#8217;s-purses <sup id="fnref:tattoo2"><a href="#fn:tattoo2" class="footnote">31</a></sup> floating down in the black needlerush <sup id="fnref:tattoo3"><a href="#fn:tattoo3" class="footnote">32</a></sup> <br />

<p>Dream at night <br />
Girl with the cobra tattoo <br />
And try to hear <br />
The garbled transmissions come through</p>

<p>The day I turned my back on all you people <br />
I felt an itching in my thumbs <br />
Salt air like a broadcast from the distant dark beyond <br />
When my transformation comes</p>

<p>I went down to the warm, warm water <br />
Saw a pelican fly past <br />
Waved once at the highway and then left all that behind me <br />
I went wading through the grass</p>

<p>And no one was gonna come and get me <br />
There wasn&#8217;t anybody gonna know <br />
Even though I leave a trail of burned things in my wake <br />
Every single place I go</p>

<p>And it was cool and it was quiet <br />
In the humid marsh down there <br />
I let my head sink down beneath the brackish water <br />
Felt it gumming up my hair</p>

<p>The sun was sinking into the Atlantic <br />
The last time that I turned my back on you <br />
I tried to summon up a little prayer as I went under <br />
It was the best that I could do</p>

<p>And I said let them all fare better than your servant <br />
The reeds all pricking at my skin <br />
Here&#8217;s hoping they have better luck than I had down here with you <br />
All that water rushing in</p>

<h2 id="naming">Naming Day <sup id="fnref:naming1"><a href="#fn:naming1" class="footnote">37</a></sup></h2>

<p>I am hiding in the house <br />
Someone&#8217;s coming through the gate <br />
When the doorbell sounds like an air-raid siren <br />
I am lying in wait</p>

<p>People used to come around <br />
They fish-eyed and they rubber-necked <sup id="fnref:naming2"><a href="#fn:naming2" class="footnote">38</a></sup> <br />
Anyone who&#8217;d come to visit now <br />
Is automatically a suspect</p>

<p>I creep up to the window <br />
Me and my buzzing brain <br />
And we watch two Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses <br />
Retreating down the lane</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not coming out yet <br />
It&#8217;s too cold <br />
Leave me alone &#8216;til I learn <br />
How to spin straw into gold <sup id="fnref:naming3"><a href="#fn:naming3" class="footnote">39</a></sup></p>

<p>I put on night-vision goggles <br />
Work my way along the wall into the kitchen <br />
As soon as the first snow fell this year <br />
My fingers started itching</p>

<p>And I locked up the doors <br />
And I sealed up all the windows <br />
And friends came by sometimes for a while <br />
I never let &#8216;em in though</p>

<p>And then they stopped, and then they stopped at last <br />
And now it&#8217;s just us three <br />
These walls and the Church of Jesus Christ <br />
Of the Latter Day Saints and me</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m not coming out yet <br />
It&#8217;s too cold <br />
Leave me alone &#8216;til I learn <br />
How to spin straw into gold</p>

<p>You went away to Stockholm <sup id="fnref:swallowers3"><a href="#fn:swallowers3" class="footnote">42</a></sup> for a week <br />
You came back with some scratch-marks on your cheeks <br />
The towers line the highway and they cry <br />
From deep down in their guts until they die</p>

<p>The water tower crew are total devils <br />
Toxicity near saturation levels <br />
I rise up and greet the day <br />
See the serpents rising from the clay</p>

<p>You were headed down to Salzburg <sup id="fnref:swallowers4"><a href="#fn:swallowers4" class="footnote">43</a></sup> for the night <br />
All my hair was turning white <br />
You and your crew were good to go <br />
So many people that we&#8217;ll never really know</p>

<p>I saw the city men, they make me laugh <br />
Digging up the cables, cutting them in half <br />
I watch the ancient sun until it falls <br />
See the serpents coming through the walls</p>

<h2 id="keeping">Keeping House</h2>

<p>You clean out your junk-drawer, you mop up some blood <br />
While the first of the new creatures rises from the mud <br />
Cursing the moment that saw him draw breath <br />
The ghost on your doorstep is starving to death</p>

<p>You spray down the windows, you wipe them all clean <br />
And you douse your old clothing with fresh gasoline <br />
And the ghost on your doorstep is soaked wet with rain <br />
And he clutches his stomach and howls at the pain</p>

<p>And you can stay busy all day <br />
He&#8217;s never going away</p>

<p>So let all the lights blaze, keep your heart light <br />
Play really loud music all hours of the night <br />
And when you set the table, set it for two <br />
The ghost on your doorstep has to eat, same as you <br />
Same as you</p>

      <p>&#8220;The new record, uh, people have been calling it a breakup album, which is kind of weird &#8216;cause it&#8217;s not, uh, but at the same time, uh, I mean, it&#8217;s about solitude, and, uh, which is something I have the luxury of going through while I&#8217;m on tour. It&#8217;s a great job, but you spend a lot of time by yourself in rooms and if you are a person who, uh, you know, is given to depressed states, you can really carve out some little holes for yourself, uh, in hotel rooms. And since I&#8217;m also a bit hypochondriac and don&#8217;t like to hang out with people, uh, that&#8217;s sort of, it makes me able to sort of sink into these depths when I&#8217;m out there. Which, usually I just sit there and mope, watch Law &amp; Order reruns, but a couple of tours ago, I thought, well, you know, I&#8217;ve seen all these episodes of Law &amp; Order a bunch of times, and so I started writing in the hotel rooms, &#8216;cause that had actually worked really well for <a href="http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sunset_Tree">The Sunset Tree</a>. Four of its songs were written on tour, and so, uh, actually, <a href="#woke">the one I just played</a>, uh, was the first one I wrote, in a hotel room, when I was working on this record. I wrote it in, uh, Evanston, Illinois, at a Hilton Garden Inn.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/wiki/2006-08-21_-_KEXP_Session_-_Seattle,_WA">2006-08-21 - KEXP Session - Seattle, WA</a>&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:glquote1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>&#8220;People keep saying that the new album is a breakup album. I don&#8217;t really know where they got that idea. But at the same time, you don&#8217;t want to argue with people, in case they&#8217;re fixing to say good stuff about your record. &#8216;Oh yeah, you like it, and it&#8217;s a breakup - oh yeah, breakup! Absolutely.&#8217; The fellow in <a href="#sage">this song</a> is more, uh, breaking up with, uh, the basic units of what constitutes him as a person. Uh, he hasn&#8217;t lost anybody except himself, and that&#8217;s sort of what makes it a much more solitary place to be than your standard lose-someone-you-love &#8216;cause there will be somebody else but you only have one brain.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/wiki/2006-09-29_-_Club_Europa_-_Brooklyn,_NY">2006-09-29 - Club Europa - Brooklyn, NY</a>&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:glquote2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>But this is true, that the fellow who narrates this song, uh, is losing his grip on things as they are. He&#8217;s going insane, as they would put it. And so that&#8217;s why he feels like he does. He hasn&#8217;t lost anybody or anything like that. Uh, he suffers from a sort of solitude that most of us, uh, thank God, can only really imagine, uh, so, I wrote this for a lot of people that I used to work with, and whom I think of from time to time.

      <p>&#8220;This is a song about mental illness, and how it can be hard to cope sometimes when you don&#8217;t feel like people understand what&#8217;s going on with you and it&#8217;s called &#8216;Wild Sage&#8217;.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/wiki/2013-06-08_-_Port_City_Music_Hall_-_Portland,_ME">2013-06-08 - Port City Music Hall - Portland, ME</a>&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:sage2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Rian Johnson begun making <a href="https://vimeo.com/59818092">a video for Wild Sage</a>, but did not complete it: <br />
<br />
&#8220;Back in 2006 when we shot the Woke Up New music video for the Mountain Goats, I wanted to also make something for my favorite song on the album, &#8220;Wild Sage.&#8221; So I shot John Darnielle singing the song in front of a black background, turned the footage black and white and high contrast, and printed out every frame of it on 8x10 paper. I then took these stacks of paper to Cape Cod and began to animate them as stills, shooting with my Canon 5D. It took much longer than I thought, and my vacation was over before the video was shot, so I took them back to NYC intending to finish the video there. I never did. So this is all there is. <br />
The printouts somehow ended up in my cousin Nathan&#8217;s possession, and seven years later he found them stacked in a box and asked me what these thousands of bizarre photos of John Darnielle&#8217;s face were for.
And I said &#8220;oh yeah, that thing. I should upload it to Vimeo or something.&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:sage3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>&#8220;But I had this idea when I was digging through my childhood stuff, I remembered how much I really liked monsters. And so I started to write these songs about monsters. Mentioned that on NPR and then I got a lot of mail, &#8216;so are you still working on the monster concept album?&#8217; No. But anyway, so, but, but I got a couple of them, a couple of songs about monsters done before I found some other direction, but there was something in them. There&#8217;s always something &#8211; you know. I assume you&#8217;re like me, that when you see the monster movie and all the, all the citizens of the town, you know, gather to burn the monster alive, you go, &#8216;Were people in the thirties in favor of the town, in this setup?&#8217; Because I would look at it as a kid and go - why, why are they going to kill the innocent monster from the depths? Right? He doesn&#8217;t &#8211; he was living in a cave under the ocean and then one of your people was swimming because you wanted to get some underwater footage, and, and now he has to die so that you can film people swimming under &#8211; well, that doesn&#8217;t seem right. That was my position on the monsters. That remains my position on the monsters. This is called &#8216;New Monster Avenue&#8217;.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/wiki/2006-08-22_-_Amoeba_Music_-_San_Francisco,_CA">2006-08-22 - Amoeba Music - San Francisco, CA</a>&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:avenue1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>In 2005, before it was decided to be included in Get Lonely, this song was sent to a dance troupe in San Francisco who used it to choreograph a dance: <br />
<br />
&#8220;There&#8217;s this dance company called EmSpace Dance. A couple of years ago their director, Erin Mei-Ling Stuart, wrote to me and asked whether they could choreograph some of my songs. I love dance, a lot; it makes my hair stand up on end sometimes. Still, a year later, when Erin sent me a videotape entitled Songs For You, I was shocked by how strong my reaction to it was. I feel that in EmSpace&#8217;s remarkable work, the inner lives of my songs become real and whole. Seeing them dance this piece in June was the single best hour I&#8217;ve spent this year.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.mountain-goats.com/everybody_dance/">mountain-goats.com</a> <br />

Some book or movie, oh, &#8216;The Iceman Cometh&#8217; by Eugene O&#8217;Neill&#8230;. And in this book, in this play, if you haven&#8217;t read it, uh, all these drunks are hanging around at the bar and some guy comes in and tells them all that they&#8217;re never going to make anything of their lives and they should stop pretending that they are. And then the booze stops working. [audience member: &#8216;More booze!&#8217;] No. At that point you have to drink your own helplessness. It&#8217;s considerably more costly than booze.
