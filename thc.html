<em>&#8220;Hey, cut it out.&#8221;</em> <sup id="fnref:garden-976evil"><a href="#fn:garden-976evil" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom <br />
I see the flags are flying high <br />
I hear you&#8217;ve gone and rearranged things in your room <br />
I guess you&#8217;re trying to cut off my air supply \</p>

<p>I came toward your window, real slowly <br />
I knew deep down I was about to strike oil <br />
I guess by the now the flowers in your garden know me <br />
I felt them trying to get at me through the soil</p>

<p>My bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt <br />
Moving up my ankles, but I don&#8217;t fear you <br />
The thorns began tearing at my shirt <br />
But I didn&#8217;t even care when they tore clear through</p>

<p>Your garden can&#8217;t hurt me <br />
Your flowers don&#8217;t threaten my life <br />
Your garden can&#8217;t hurt me anymore <br />
Your flowers don&#8217;t threaten my life</p>

<p>There was the sound of a lake boiling over <br />
On that day <br />
Everyone said just to sit still <br />
But the thickening air got in my way</p>

<p>So the hook&#8217;s been baited now <br />
Yeah the cheese is on the water <br />
Yeah the water&#8217;s been cleansed of all impurities <br />
But now it really doesn&#8217;t matter <br />
Let&#8217;s go, let&#8217;s go</p>

<p>Wisconsin bound <br />
Wisconsin bound <br />
Wisconsin bound, yeah <br />
Wisconsin bound</p>

<p>The bottom of the boat was a hotplate come alive <br />
But the boat wasn&#8217;t real, and this is how I feel <br />
You don&#8217;t know where you are until you arrive <br />
And the frogs sang out from the distant banks <br />
And you say you need me in California <br />
But no thanks</p>

<p>Wisconsin bound <br />
Wisconsin bound <br />
Wisconsin bound <br />
Yeah, Wisconsin bound <br />
Let&#8217;s go</p>

<p>I hear you moving in the hallway <br />
I hear you sharpening your claws <br />
I hear you polishing your teeth sometimes <br />
But I don&#8217;t mind</p>

<p>And I hear you out in the garage <br />
I hear you messing with the motor <br />
I hear you tinker with the engine sometimes <br />
But I don&#8217;t mind</p>

<p>And I hear you moving in the kitchen <br />
I hear you in there late at night <br />
I notice when you leave the gas jets on sometimes <br />
But I don&#8217;t mind</p>

<h2 id="negative">Alpha Negative <sup id="fnref:negative1"><a href="#fn:negative1" class="footnote">13</a></sup></h2>

<p>The house was pretty and the yard was wide <br />
And I felt strong with you at my side <br />
Your eyes at night had a beautiful glowing in them <br />
And I knew in my heart just what was growing in them</p>

<p>Ah, but you made me drink poison <br />
It felt smooth running down my throat <br />
I love you, and you made me drink poison <br />
It was cool and smooth and sweet <br />
Do you remember?</p>

<p>We had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard <br />
And I quit my job, so I could hold you all the time <br />
I tried to stop the thing metastasizing in us <br />
But in the warm, slow evening <br />
I could feel it rising in us</p>

<p>Ah, and you made me drink poison <br />
It felt so smooth sliding down my throat <br />
I love you so much, and you made me drink poison <br />
It was cool and smooth and sweet and cool <br />
And smooth and sweet and cool and smooth</p>

<p>The sun was coming up, and our friend was sound asleep <br />
But we saw through the window that the water ran so deep <br />
That you couldn&#8217;t make out the ocean floor <br />
Then I saw you in the light <br />
I couldn&#8217;t take it any more</p>

<p>Give me your hand <br />
Give me everything you&#8217;ve got <br />
And the light from window will fall on us burning hot  <br />
Just like a torch</p>

<p>The air was humid; I will not forget <br />
When we stepped outside, I hear your footsteps <br />
Now in my mind, it&#8217;s a soft sound <br />
Almost imperceptible against the giving ground</p>

<p>Let me kiss your eyelids with my lips <br />
Let me feel the heat coming off your fingertips <br />
Just like a torch</p>

<p>Bang, pow! Look at me now <br />
Don&#8217;t let the cows stray off too far <br />
Come down, take a good look around <br />
See how the cows start to shine like light bulbs</p>

<p>I love the cows <br />
I love the cows <br />
I love the cows, yeah <br />
I love the cows</p>

<p>Rain comes, strikes you dumb <br />
Re-seed the meadow so the cows don&#8217;t starve <br />
Mud puddle&#8217;s a fine place to cuddle <br />
You&#8217;re a mosquito or a mosquito&#8217;s baby</p>

<p>I love the cows <br />
I love the cows <br />
I love the cows <br />
I love the cows</p>

<p>They&#8217;re smiling in your face <br />
All the time they wanna take your place <br />
Yeah you know who I mean <br />
Talkin&#8217; about those cow-machines</p>

<p>Well I see you&#8217;ve left me a photograph <br />
Of a leopard tearing an antelope in half <br />
What have you done <br />
What have you done <br />
What have you done <br />
With our love <br />
What have you done</p>

<p>Well I see you&#8217;ve resorted to petty theft <br />
You want to take something from me <br />
But there&#8217;s nothing left <br />
What have you done <br />
What have you done <br />
What have you done <br />
With our love <br />
Where have you put it</p>

<p>Well I hear you calling from way over there <br />

<p>I saw you at your window <br />
I saw you in the sun <br />
I saw you in the window looking out</p>

<p>I reached my hand in there <br />
Then I touched your hair <br />
And felt myself burn in the morning</p>

<p>And the chickens were screaming <br />
Black dog at my heels <br />
And the bluejays were coughing up in the trees</p>

<p>I&#8217;d forgotten my name <br />
I felt kind of ashamed <br />
And felt myself burn in the morning</p>

<p>I saw you at your window <br />
At the beginning of summer <br />
And invisible stars sent their heat down</p>

<p>I imagined your touch <br />
It was almost too much <br />
Burned like a bonfire in the morning</p>

I could spend the rest of my life in there \</p>

<p>I saw you and I sank into your eyes <br />
I&#8217;m not going to apologize</p>

<p>Because you with your own hands <br />
Made the whole world <br />
You can&#8217;t fool me <br />
I&#8217;m onto you now</p>

<p>Because you with your own hands <br />
Created everything <br />
You can&#8217;t fool me <br />
I&#8217;m onto you now</p>

<p>Yeah, I saw you, but you saw me first <br />
Living water to quench my thirst <br />
And you tell me quiet down <br />
But I have no doubt <br />
I know what you&#8217;re all about</p>

<p>You were all were dressed in green <br />
Clouds bounced against the edges of the sky <br />
You had the prettiest hair I&#8217;d ever seen <br />
We saw the world passing by</p>

<p>There was an ocean&#8217;s droning <br />
Though we were nowhere near the shore <br />
We heard each other giggling and moaning <br />
Then we couldn&#8217;t hear each other any more yeah</p>

<p>When my head was resting on your breastbone <br />
I could hear your beating heart <br />
24 hours later you had left me completely alone <br />
I heard the whole world come apart</p>

<p>And you were all dressed in green <br />
Rising in the sky was an unfamiliar star <br />
You know, you know what I mean <br />
Yeah I remember who you are</p>

<p>Water came springing out the side of the wall <br />
And I guess the same thing will happen to us all <br />
We don&#8217;t know how to explain what I mean <br />
I mean to say it&#8217;s kind of hard to explain now</p>

<p>Let them kill me <br />

<p>Water came down through the cracks in the ceiling <br />
But this time the water had a different feeling <br />
It&#8217;s the sort of feeling that is hard to explain <br />
So, let me put it to you in a different way now</p>

<p>Let them kill me <br />
Let them kill me <br />
