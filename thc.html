<p>I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom <br />
I see the flags are flying high <br />
I hear you&#8217;ve gone and rearranged things in your room <br />
I guess you&#8217;re trying to cut off my air supply</p>

<p>I came toward your window, real slowly <br />
I knew deep down I was about to strike oil <br />
I guess by the now the flowers in your garden know me <br />
I felt them trying to get at me through the soil</p>

<p>My bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt <br />
Moving up my ankles, but I don&#8217;t fear you <br />
The thorns began tearing at my shirt <br />
But I didn&#8217;t even care when they tore clear through</p>

<p>Your garden can&#8217;t hurt me <br />
Your flowers don&#8217;t threaten my life <br />

<p>There was the sound of a lake boiling over <br />
On that day <br />
Everyone said just to sit still <br />
But the thickening air got in my way</p>

<p>So the hook&#8217;s been baited now <br />
Yeah the cheese is on the water <br />
Yeah the water&#8217;s been cleansed of all impurities <sup id="fnref:wisconsin-fishboil"><a href="#fn:wisconsin-fishboil" class="footnote">10</a></sup> <br />

Let&#8217;s go, let&#8217;s go</p>

<p>Wisconsin bound <br />
Wisconsin bound <br />
Wisconsin bound, yeah <br />
Wisconsin bound</p>

<p>The bottom of the boat was a hotplate come alive <br />
But the boat wasn&#8217;t real, and this is how I feel <br />
You don&#8217;t know where you are until you arrive <br />
And the frogs sang out from the distant banks <br />
And you say you need me in California <br />
But no thanks</p>

<p>Wisconsin bound <br />

Yeah, Wisconsin bound <br />

I hear you sharpening your claws <br />
I hear you polishing your teeth sometimes <br />
But I don&#8217;t mind</p>

<p>And I hear you out in the garage <br />
I hear you messing with the motor <br />
I hear you tinker with the engine sometimes <br />
But I don&#8217;t mind</p>

<p>And I hear you moving in the kitchen <br />
I hear you in there late at night <br />

<p>The house was pretty and the yard was wide <br />
And I felt strong with you at my side <br />
Your eyes at night had a beautiful glowing in them <br />
And I knew in my heart just what was growing in them</p>

<p>Ah, but you made me drink poison <br />
It felt smooth running down my throat <br />
I love you, and you made me drink poison <br />
It was cool and smooth and sweet <br />
Do you remember?</p>

<p>We had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard <br />
And I quit my job, so I could hold you all the time <br />
I tried to stop the thing metastasizing <sup id="fnref:alpha-cancer"><a href="#fn:alpha-cancer" class="footnote">16</a></sup> in us <br />
But in the warm, slow evening <br />
I could feel it rising in us</p>

<p>Ah, and you made me drink poison <br />
It felt so smooth sliding down my throat <br />
I love you so much, and you made me drink poison <br />
It was cool and smooth and sweet and cool <br />

<p>The sun was coming up, and our friend was sound asleep <br />
But we saw through the window that the water ran so deep <br />
That you couldn&#8217;t make out the ocean floor <br />
Then I saw you in the light <br />
I couldn&#8217;t take it any more</p>

<p>Give me your hand <br />
Give me everything you&#8217;ve got <br />
And the light from window will fall on us burning hot  <br />
Just like a torch</p>

<p>The air was humid; I will not forget <br />
When we stepped outside, I hear your footsteps <br />
Now in my mind, it&#8217;s a soft sound <br />
Almost imperceptible against the giving ground</p>

<p>Let me kiss your eyelids with my lips <br />
Let me feel the heat coming off your fingertips <br />
Just like a torch</p>

See how the cows start to shine like light bulbs</p>

<p>I love the cows <br />

<p>I reached my hand in there <br />
Then I touched your hair <br />
And felt myself burn in the morning</p>

<p>And the chickens were screaming <br />
Black dog at my heels <br />
And the bluejays were coughing up in the trees</p>

<p>I&#8217;d forgotten my name <br />
I felt kind of ashamed <br />
And felt myself burn in the morning</p>

<p>I saw you at your window <br />
At the beginning of summer <br />
And invisible stars sent their heat down</p>

<p>I imagined your touch <br />
It was almost too much <br />
Burned like a bonfire in the morning</p>

We saw the world passing by</p>

Though we were nowhere near the shore <br />
We heard each other giggling and moaning <br />
Then we couldn&#8217;t hear each other any more yeah</p>

<p>When my head was resting on your breastbone <br />
I could hear your beating heart <br />
24 hours later you had left me completely alone <br />
I heard the whole world come apart</p>

Rising in the sky was an unfamiliar star <br />

&#8220;Like a lot of college singer-songwriter guys, I thought it&#8217;d be really intense if you had songs where the rejected lover is, like, totally stalking somebody. You may find this with your guys with acoustic guitars in college, is that they write these songs and they think that you will like them better if the protagonist in their song is, like, stalking his beloved. Guys are confused; they grow out of this, right? But for the moment, they really think it&#8217;s super intense to have a narrator who&#8217;s going to immolate himself if he doesn&#8217;t get the love he wants. I went through that myself with the songs; this is on The Hound Chronicles and I feel really silly playing it. It&#8217;s called &#8216;The Garden Song&#8217;.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/wiki/2006-12-02_-_Pitzer_College_-_Claremont,_CA">2006-12-02 - Pitzer College - Claremont, CA</a>&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:garden-stalker" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>This sample from the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/976-EVIL">976-EVIL</a> appears to continue throughout the entire track; but only the first part, before the song starts, is audible. At approx. 57:30 in the movie there is a fight between two high school-aged boys:
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Spike when you need him?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m warning you&#8221;

      <p>&#8220;This is another one of those little songs, uh, about two people who I love so much that I continue to cause them to harm one another, uh, and I imagine them in my mind cursing me, but they can&#8217;t do it without my permission, &#8216;cause they&#8217;re my people, so. It&#8217;s a very old song. I hope someday they&#8217;ll forgive me, but I suspect that they won&#8217;t.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/wiki/2001-06-23_-_Bottom_of_the_Hill_-_San_Francisco,_CA">2001-06-23 - Bottom of the Hill - San Francisco, CA</a>&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:alpha-forgive" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>&#8220;This song also has a message, but it&#8217;s a sort of simpler message. And that is: if the person that you live with and love is trying to kill you, it&#8217;s best to leave.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://themountaingoats.wikia.com/wiki/2002-03-07_-_Independent_Media_Center_-_Urbana,_IL">2002-03-07 - Independent Media Center - Urbana, IL</a>&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:alpha-kill" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>&#8220;Well, there was this one guy who always wanted to hear that one. He&#8217;s been showing up for twenty years. But everybody else was like, &#8216;Wow, that was weird and not like the other songs. It seemed like it was written by a very different person who, you know, had a little more death in his heart than the other one we&#8217;ve come to know, right.

      <p>Referencing God creating everything with his hands. Multiple Bible verses use similar language, such as Isaiah 45:2, &#8220;I made the earth, I created the people who live on it. My hands stretched out the heavens, I gave orders to all the heavenly lights&#8221;; Psalms 8:3 observes that the heavens were &#8220;made by God&#8217;s fingers&#8221; and Psalms 19:1 &#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God; the sky displays his handiwork.&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:rat-psalms" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:rat-water">

      <p>Water is a rich symbol in the Bible. In Jeremiah 2:13 and 17:13 God calls himself &#8220;The living water.&#8221; Jesus speaks about it in John 4:10, &#8220;If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:rat-water" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Possibly a reference to Luke 4:35, in which Jesus silences a possessed man who is afraid of him and rebuked the demon inside him. &#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; Jesus said sternly. &#8220;Come out of him!&#8221; Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. However, God often instructs silence, quiet, peace etc and there are many hundreds of verses which encourage this practice.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:rat-luke" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
